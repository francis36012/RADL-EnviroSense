# NOTE:
# 	There are also 2x potentiometers on the board for adjusting measuring distance and hold time
# 	Rotate the pot labelled "Delay time" clockwise to decrease the hold time (0.3s - 25s)
# 	Rotate the pot labelled "Distance" clockwise to decrease the measuring distance (10cm - 6m)
	
# 	There are multiple revisions of this board with different components for setting retriggerable/non-retriggerable.
# 	Revision 1.0 contains a switch and revision 1.2 contains a jumper hat.
# 	The 1.0 switch board is labelled with H,L - H=retriggerable, L=non-retriggerable.
# 	The 1.2 jumper board has a pin diagram s.sended on the back.
	
# 	retriggerable means the sensor will continue outputting high if motion was detected before the hold timer expires.
# 	non-retriggerable means the sensor will output high for the specified hold time only, then output low until motion is detected again.
# 	if there is constant motion detected, retriggerable will stay high for the duration and non-retriggerable will oscillate between high/low.
